## Plan 1: Terrestrial Seed Bank (Svalbard)

### Objective
Establish a comprehensive seed bank backup system in Svalbard to preserve terrestrial biodiversity.

### Game Plan

**Phase 1: Research & Assessment**
- Document existing Svalbard Global Seed Vault capabilities and limitations
- Identify critical agricultural and native species requiring backup
- Research compatible climate conditions and storage infrastructure in Svalbard
- Assess current partnership opportunities with Norwegian institutions

**Phase 2: Species Selection & Collection**
- Prioritize endangered and culturally significant seed varieties
- Establish seed collection partnerships with agricultural organizations globally
- Create metadata cataloging system (species, origin, collection date, genetic info)
- Implement proper seed preparation and preservation protocols

**Phase 3: Infrastructure Development**
- Design redundant storage facilities (primary + backup locations)
- Implement climate-controlled environments (temperature, humidity monitoring)
- Establish backup power systems and emergency protocols
- Create access management and security protocols

**Phase 4: Documentation & Knowledge Management**
- Develop comprehensive seed inventory database
- Create restoration guides for each species variant
- Document growing conditions and germination protocols
- Establish knowledge transfer protocols to regional institutions

**Phase 5: Maintenance & Testing**
- Schedule regular viability testing protocols
- Implement ongoing monitoring systems
- Plan periodic germination testing without compromising seed stocks
- Update records and adapt based on findings

**Success Metrics**
- Minimum 10,000+ seed varieties documented and stored
- 99%+ long-term viability preservation rate
- Full redundancy across backup systems
- Quarterly testing and reporting cycles
