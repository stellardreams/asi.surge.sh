# Ledger: Interplanetary Foundations

## SMART Goal: Type III Industrial Backbone
**Specific**: Construct the primary logistical spine and manufacturing backbone between Mars and the Asteroid Belt.
**Measurable**: 10 operational AMU Factory Hubs in the Belt; establish the Interplanetary Legal Ledger on the blockchain.
**Achievable**: Utilizing self-replicating AMU clusters and autonomous deep-space transport.
**Relevant**: Forms the base for long-term galactic expansion.
**Time-bound**: Hub backbone operational by 2035.

## Actionable Tasks
1. [ ] **Backbone Mapping**: Chart high-efficiency trajectories for AMU hub placement (Month 6).
2. [ ] **Legal Ledger**: Deploy the v1 Interplanetary Legal Framework on a public blockchain (Month 8).
3. [ ] **Replication Pilot**: Success-test self-replication cycles in a deep-space simulation (Month 12).
4. [ ] **Logistical Spine**: Initiate the first long-range transport loop for heavy infrastructure (Month 24).
5. [ ] **Governance Node**: Establish the Wikipedia Model for project-wide real-time auditing (Month 30).

## Key Milestones
- **M1**: Interplanetary Ledger Genesis Block.
- **M2**: First successful AMU-to-AMU replication in transit.
- **M3**: Logistical Spine operational between Earth and Mars orbit.
