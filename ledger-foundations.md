# Ledger: Interplanetary Foundations

## SMART Goal: Type III Industrial Backbone
Specific:
- Construct the primary logistical spine and manufacturing backbone between Mars and the Asteroid Belt.

Measurable:
- ITN (Interplanetary Transport Network) traversable by (insert date)
  - - ITN would have to be mapped first. 
  - - - Preliminary set of emails unanswered
- Direct transport (point to point) not feasible, considering larger volumes across distances.
- -  Unless fusion power achieved or SBSP opens up.
- - - SBSP main leaders, historic in US, but ambitious plans by China and Middle Eastern countries investing heavily (surface level scan)
- - - - Ideal scenario, everyone works together to cleanup and secure outer space.
- -  In general, point to point travel in outer space (what we refer to as deep space right now across the solar system) can only happen if energy costs plummet exponentially
- - - exception, deep space travel possible for smaller scale vessels (size of credit card). but it's one way
- - - - I had some ideas here actually
- a number of problems to solve, prior to 10 operational AMU Factory Hubs in the Belt.
- talk to Lewicki (no affiliation as of yet) about identifcation of real estate via mapping. PR did some work here
- Establish the Interplanetary Legal Ledger on the blockchain
- Anticipate pushback from specific circles. Pre-empt.
  - Design plans to integrate. Prepare offers in advance. 
  - Design plans to anticipate outcomes in the kubler ross sense. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief)
  - Prepare workforce for the long haul. 

Achievable:
- Utilizing self-replicating AMU clusters and autonomous deep-space transport. - Detailed plan via [issue 5](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh/issues/5) and sub-tasks

Relevant:
- Forms the base for long-term galactic expansion.
- Talk to Dr. Loeb (no affiliation as of yet). He's involved in a couple of projects that could be relevant.

Time-bound:
- Hub backbone operational by 2035.

## Actionable Tasks
1. [ ] **Backbone Mapping**: Chart high-efficiency trajectories for AMU hub placement (Month 6).
2. [ ] **Legal Ledger**: Deploy the v1 Interplanetary Legal Framework on a public blockchain (Month 8).
3. [ ] **Replication Pilot**: Success-test self-replication cycles in a deep-space simulation (Month 12).
4. [ ] **Logistical Spine**: Initiate the first long-range transport loop for heavy infrastructure (Month 24).
5. [ ] **Governance Node**: Establish the Wikipedia Model for project-wide real-time auditing (Month 30).

## Key Milestones
- **M1**: Interplanetary Ledger Genesis Block.
- **M2**: First successful AMU-to-AMU replication in transit. (first on surface and then in orbit) | Suffice to say, this is a huge undertaking and should be initiated today for TRL 9 to be achieved sooner than later
- **M3**: Logistical Spine operational between Earth and Mars orbit.

## Resources
- Advanced Japanese American Robotics Startup (name withheld)
- Architecture Designers
- Remote Operations Teams | The Australians do this well and Canadians are also good at it
- Strategic Peace Mandate Officers OTAN StratComE maybe? Stanford Peace via Mark
- Blockchain Architects
- Lead Ethicists
- AI Aligners (Hmm, how much of alignment related work feeds into this. I guess it depends upon the level of autonomy that is going to be exercised and other factors. like future of work and the degree to which we will have humans in the loop)
