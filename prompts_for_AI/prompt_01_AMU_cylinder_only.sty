Note: Issue #14 was leveraged on the repo in order to create this prompt.
1. Define the Role: Alright, I'd like for you to take on the persona of an elite python developer who writes scripts that can be loaded up into Blender. The purpose for doing do is so that we can get started on actually developing our inventions ourselves. vs relying on AI (artificial intelligence) to do that. There are a set of reasons for this. and in random order. a. One is simply the budget. So we'd need to budget for the higher tiered models. Whether it's through regular AI models or AI models specifically designed for inventors. b. The secon reason is that the lack of an engineer on the team at the moment does not mean that the work has to stall. We've already lost 5 years, because there has not been an engineer on the team. If we had planted the first orchard on the moon 5 years ago, then we could have had a decent yield by now. perhaps not enough to offset the reality that olive oil cannot be afforded by the common population increasingly and it is also a nutrient that is crucial for the development of the brain. So this is our main why. c. part of the previous reason is that, I've been tinkering with, well tinkercad for Shangrila-VHP (another project that I have) and in general. So I am pretty sure that with steady practice, we can take a tiered approach to graduate from tinkercad to autocad and then from there to other software tools like ANSYS. 
2. Clearly State the Task: So we want to write a script to generate a 3d model, let's start the specific details below 
3. Provide Specific Detail
a. python script that I can load into blender
b. this python script will make a 3d model of the AMU (Autonomous Manufacturing Unit) which is the flagship product of our endeavour here at ASI or now rebranded as Awakened Imagination (we should really stick with one name right?) 
c. So seeing that I have a small 3d-printer and yes, we want to 3d-print the very first 3d-printed version of the AMU. I am open to suggestions, but I think the dimensions should be

Dimensions:
- 80 mm horizontal length - x axis 
- 30 mm vertical height - y axis 
- 30 mm across - z axis
Important note: the structure is hollow on the inside, with walls that are 1.2 mm thick.
Note: the sides should be rounded off with a fillet of radius, so that the edges are not sharp

Specify Mechanical or Functional Requirements
Cavities for doors or access points on the sides
- We want two cavities inside the hollow structure. they are both squares
- these cavities would be 6 mm wide and 6 mm long. They are going to take the same dimensions as the thickness of the walls (above)

- these cavities will be placed 20 mm from the outher most edges
- for the y axis, the cavities will be 3 mm from the base of the cylinder. So when they are manufactured in adequate proportions, a human or a robot could also step inside of them
- 40 mm would be the center: On the top of the structure, in the distance that is in the middle with respect to the two cavities we want to create a base that is 
- 8 mm horizontal length - x axis 
- 2 mm vertical height - y axis 
- 6 mm across  - z axis
