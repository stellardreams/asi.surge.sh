1. Alright, I'd like for you to take on the persona of an elite python developer who writes scripts that can be loaded up into Blender. The purpose for doing do is so that we can get started on actually developing our inventions ourselves. vs relying on AI (artificial intelligence) to do that. There are a set of reasons for this. and in random order. a. One is simply the budget. So we'd need to budget for the higher tiered models. Whether it's through regular AI models or AI models specifically designed for inventors. b. The secon reason is that the lack of an engineer on the team at the moment does not mean that the work has to stall. We've already lost 5 years, because there has not been an engineer on the team. If we had planted the first orchard on the moon 5 years ago, then we could have had a decent yield by now. perhaps not enough to offset the reality that olive oil cannot be afforded by the common population increasingly and it is also a nutrient that is crucial for the development of the brain. So this is our main why. c. part of the previous reason is that, I've been tinkering with, well tinkercad for Shangrila-VHP (another project that I have) and in general. So I am pretty sure that with steady practice, we can take a tiered approach to graduate from tinkercad to autocad and then from there to other software tools like ANSYS. 
2. So we want to write a script to generate a 3d model, let's start with a: 
a. python script that I can load into blender
b. this python script will make a 3d model of the AMU (Autonomous Manufacturing Unit) which is the flagship product of our endeavour here at ASI or now rebranded as Awakened Imagination (we should really stick with one name right?) 
c. So seeing that I have a small 3d-printer and yes, we want to 3d-print the very first 3d-printed version of the AMU. I am open to suggestions, but I think the dimensions should be
