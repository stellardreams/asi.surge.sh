# Ledger: Stewardship & Security

## SMART Goal: Establish "Aura" Orbital Domain Security
Specific:
- Security hygiene is of utmost importance. 
- Concurrently, consult with Dr. Jah extensively
  - - Assessment of current debris situation.
  - - Assessment of current debris removal technologies.
  - - Assessment of current debris monitoring technologies.
  - - Assessment of current debris legal frameworks.
  - - Assessment of current debris legal frameworks.
  - - Assessment of projected debris situation
- Gain necessary approvals
- A typical lean approach, throw it in the orbit and see if it sticks will not work. 
  - TRL level to 9 is required for launch.
- Successful iterations to determine next steps. Which will include:
  - Securing funding for the project.
  - Building a world class team or teams.
  - Gaining the necessary approvals from the relevant authorities.
  - Asking how to communicate with other space agencies
  - Asking other space agencies on how to avoid miscommunication (in an era of ASAT and other space weaponization like satellite recon/trailing formations)
  - Communicating plans to the public and relevant stakeholders.
  - Deployment of "Aura Sweeper" in swarm clusters for debris removal.
  - Establish the "Orbital Sentry" compute layer.

Measurable:
- Reduction of tracked mm-scale debris by 40% in LEO/MEO.

Achievable:
- Utilizing 3-stage AMU self-replicating swarms.
- I am not sure, but I think the deployment will be in MEO? Fuel costs will be a determinant. Unless, ion thruster can be secured/licensed.

Relevant:
- Avoid the Kessler Syndrome [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dft7-yNSabc)
- Crucial for safe long-term space development.
- Essential for Earth's protection.

Time-bound:
- Operational by Q4 2026.
  - Note: A bit ambitious there, Gemini. But let's see!

## Actionable Tasks
1. [ ] **Protocol Design**: Finalize "Aura" swarm coordination logic and collision avoidance (Month 1).
2. [ ] **Hardware Iteration**: Prototype mm-debris collection mesh for AMU stage-2 (Month 3).
3. [ ] **Sentry Deployment**: Launch initial 3 blockchain verification nodes for the Orbital Compute Layer (Month 6).
4. [ ] **Legal Ratification**: Publicly release the "Strategic Peace Mandate" via the Wikipedia Model for community edit/audit (Month 8).
5. [ ] **Swarm Launch**: Initiate the first flight of 100 sweeper units (Month 12).

## Key Milestones
- **M1**: Debris cataloging interface live.
- **M2**: First autonomous mesh deployment in a simulation.
- **M3**: Live domain security protocol active.

## Resources
- AMU Factory Nodes
- Blockchain Developers
- Lead Ethicists
- Computer Vision Specialists
