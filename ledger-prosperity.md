# Ledger: Global Prosperity

## SMART Goal: The Great Industry Migration
Specific:
- Transition the top 20 most biosphere-polluting terrestrial industries to off-world AMU-based production.

Measurable:
- 15% reduction in terrestrial heavy manufacturing carbon footprint.
- Extraction of 1,000 tons of high-purity refined materials from Psyche-class asteroids.

Achievable:
- Phased deployment of AMU Stage-3 Industrial Cores.

Relevant:
- Core mission of healing the Earth while securing abundance.

Time-bound:
- First 5 industries transitioned by 2030.

## Actionable Tasks
1. [ ] **Eco-Audit**: Identify the 20 highest-impact carbon/chemical polluters on Earth (Month 1).
2. [ ] **Material Analysis**: Simulation of off-world manufacturing equivalents for steel, aluminum, and titanium (Month 4).
3. [ ] **Orbital Loop**: Establish the high-cadence delivery system for material reentry (Month 12). 
    - Note: There is a Khosla Ventures funded startup already doing this. This startup is called 'Varda Space' [link](https://www.varda.com/company/). I emailed them, as their designs were eerily similar to AMUs. However, AMUs were never designed for re-entry and nor was it ever conceived to be in LEO (Low Earth Orbit)
4. [ ] **Industry Partnerships**: Form alliances with legacy manufacturers for decommissioning strategies (Month 18).
5. [ ] **Restoration Initiate**: Begin re-wilding programs on former industrial sites (Month 24).

## Key Milestones
- **M1**: "The Most Polluting Top 20 Industries" list published.
- **M2**: First 100kg of Psyche-refined material reaches Earth surface.
- **M3**: First terrestrial factory shutdown in favor of production at 
    - - identify candidates for shutdown: <Artemis Base x y z, L4, L5, or O'Neill Cylinders, Deep Space via ITN e.t.c>
