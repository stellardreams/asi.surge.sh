<h2> Mission</h2>
Tap into the enormous resource of positivity. Our collective human potential. In order to help enable a better reality for all life on earth. Feed the world quality and nutritious foods by going to space. Create beautiful physical surroundings on and off of earth.

<h2>Primary areas of interest</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Terraform Venus.</li>
  <p>
  The primary idea is to put an autonomous factory in the orbit of Venus. This factory is going to create units, that will be launched in the atmosphere of Venus. The units are specifically designed for the purpose of sequestering larger amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere of Venus. Realizing the fact that this is a very harsh environment.</p>

  <li>Enable or help enable O'Neill colonies and Stanford Toruses. For the purpose of longer term settlements, scientific and mining outposts, deep space exploration (Exploring the solar system and beyond!)</li>
  <li>Exploring Europa in a hygienic manner.</li>
  <li>Extract hydrocarbons from Titan. Provided no life has been found on the planet.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Sister companies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://auh.surge.sh/" target="_blank"> Awake Universal Healthcare. </a></li> | <b>Note:</b> All of our profits will be redirected to AUH. For the purpose of enabling a quality healthcare infrastructure for the solar system. Minus a salary for the employees (base and compensation. Capped at a certain rate and inflation adjusted), R&D (Research and development) efforts, supporting a limited number of charities and enabling the architecture for impact pledges.
  <li><a href="https://www.launchtoday.org/" target="_blank"> Launch Today. </a></li>
</ul>

<h2> Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Radical transparency.</li>
  <li>Trust.</li>
  <li>Help reduce and to eventually eliminate all unnecessary suffering.</li>
  <li>Promoting freedoms.</li>
  <li>Leave a place better than we experienced it.</li>
</ul>

<h2> For Future partners (employees) at Awake</h2>
We offer:
<ul>
	<li>A collaborative, open, inclusive work environment. Where ideas > heirarchy</li>
	<li>Base salary</li>
  	<li>Shares in the organization are going to be allocated based on a) A vesting schedule and b) The human population will actually determine what the individual contributor's share should be. This is something that we are currently evaluating. As well, this is something that we are going to build on top of a public/private blockchain. Effectively speaking, the organization and the original founding team is not going to have control over how the shares are allocated.</li>
	<li>Benefits. Including but not limited to: Health insurance, basic dental related service (for now), mental health, vision care (eyeglasses and eye exams for now), sick days (physiological, psychological, emotional well-being). <b>Note:</b> Everything is super basic right now. As we do not have sales and we have not raised any money. </li>
	<li>Schedule: Monday to Thursday.</li>
	<li>Open to suggestions. What else should be added to this list?</li>
</ul>


<h2> Our work to date</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/85qk9-329/588e103c74123c4" target="_blank">Universal milestones and mission statement</a></li>

<p></p>

<h2> Problems/Opportunities space</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Technical</li>
		<ul>
			<li>No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel" target="_blank">known technology</a> exists at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level" target="_blank">TRL Level 7</a>. That can safely take (and bring back) humans or machines to the destination of choice.
			<li>No one has launched an autonomous manufacturing unit in an actual orbit of a planetary body. We anticipate many problems that will need to be solved here.</li>
			<li>A core part towards ensuring mission success is the need to see breakthroughs in the domain of materials science. As of right now, this is not something that we have timed. Meaning, we do not know what is the current state of development and as it relates to this discipline of science/engineering.</li>
			<li>We do not know how larger amounts of CO2 are going to be sequestered. Once sequestered/fixed, a solution for transporting the CO2 has yet to be devised.</li>
			<li>As of right now, there are no adequate provisions for the harsh conditions that constructs that enter the atmosphere of Venus are going to experience. Including but not limited to: 
				<ul>
					<li>Corrosion due to the presence of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere</li>
					<li>Extremely strong winds. Depending on the altitude, the winds can be excess of hundreds of km (Upto 360 km/h or 220 mph)</li>
					<li>Extreme temperatures. Hot and cold.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>Financial</li>
		<ul>
			<li>As of this point in time. The following costs are not known:
				<ul>
					<li>Actual cost towards successfully completing specific milestones is not yet known. Hence, the overall cost is also something that is not known as of this point in time.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The platform enabled on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank">'smart contract'</a> technology is yet to be developed. We anticipate a world where anyone/anywhere can contribute towards the enablement of this project. And be adequately compensated for doing so. Provided the work is of sufficient quality. 
				 	
		</ul>
  	<li>Ethical</li>
  		<ul>
			<li>Security: Provisions against ensuring that the technology is not abused and weaponized.</li> 
  		</ul>		

	<li>Legal</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The lack of a global framework for governance may pose challenges. On the other hand, a very strict regulatory framework may prevent new ideas from being tested and/or may perpetuate a monopolistic framework. A monopolistic framework that isn't good for the common good of all life.</li>
			<li>A structure for ensuring that further amendments and as it relates to the <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html" target="_blank">Outer Space Treaty</a> are the set of changes that are going to be good (in a universal sense of the word imaginable) for the majority of life on this planet.</li>
			<li>What sort of a legal framework/structure must organizations and individuals adhere to.</li>  
			<li>How will the land mass be divided.</li>
			<li>Will a for-profit mechanism still be operational. Why or why not.</li>
