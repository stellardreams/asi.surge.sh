# Ledger: Lamport Systems Engineering & Distributed Computing

## SMART Goal: Formal Verification and Coordination of Distributed Space Systems
Specific:
- Implement formal verification methods (using TLA+ or similar tools) to ensure correctness of AMU swarm coordination protocols.
- Apply Lamport timestamps and logical clock concepts to synchronize distributed operations across the Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN).
- Utilize Byzantine fault tolerance principles to ensure reliable operation of space systems despite component failures.
- Leverage sequential consistency and state machine replication concepts for orbital compute layers.

Measurable:
- Zero critical bugs in distributed coordination protocols due to race conditions or timing issues.
- Demonstrably correct consensus algorithms in AMU swarms through formal verification.
- Verified safety properties for all distributed decision-making processes.

Achievable:
- Through rigorous application of Lamport's formal methods and distributed systems theory.
- By implementing proven algorithms for mutual exclusion, consensus, and fault-tolerant computing.

Relevant:
- Critical for ensuring safe, reliable operation of autonomous systems in space environments.
- Essential for preventing catastrophic failures in distributed space infrastructure.
- Foundational for achieving TRL 9 (Technology Readiness Level 9) in complex distributed systems.

Time-bound:
- Initial formal models developed by Month 6.
- Verification of core protocols completed by Month 12.

## Notes
This ledger addresses the critical need for provably correct distributed systems in space applications. Leslie Lamport's foundational work in distributed systems, logical time, and formal verification provides the theoretical basis for ensuring the reliability of our space-based infrastructure. This work is particularly important for coordinating AMU swarms and the "Orbital Sentry" compute layer mentioned in the Stewardship ledger.
