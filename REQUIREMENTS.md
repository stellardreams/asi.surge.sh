# Requirements Document - Awakened Imagination

This document outlines the core functional and non-functional requirements for the Awakened Imagination Ecosystem, as derived from the exhaustive review of the existing vision and technical logs.

## 1. Core Ethos & Governance
- **Wikipedia Model**: All operations must maintain radical transparency.
- **Interplanetary Legal Framework**: Establishment of the first interplanetary legal common heritage.
- **Peace Mandate**: Prevention of heavy weaponry in orbital commons; enforcement via universal sanctions.
- **Humanitarian Focus**: Elimination of scarcity and suffering through abundance.

## 2. Technical Infrastructure
- **3-Stage AMU Architecture**: Semi-autonomous manufacturing units capable of self-replication and re-orientation.
- **Orbital Compute Layer**: Blockchain-based verification and computer vision sentry for security.
- **Logistical Core**: High-cadence transport and sustainable fuel depots.

## 3. Environmental Stewardship
- **Earth Healing**: Phase-out of terrestrial heavy manufacturing in favor of orbital alternatives.
- **Orbital Cleanup**: "Aura Sweeper" clusters for removal of debris down to mm-scale.
- **Biosphere Restoration**: Large-scale re-wilding of Earth once industry is moved off-planet.

## 4. Planetary Life Support
- **Zero-Gravity Bioreactors**: Scaling manufacturing of complex organs to eliminate global transplant scarcity.
- **Nutritional Integrity**: High-yield orbital agricultural facilities (v8 Greenhouse) providing carcinogen-free nutrition.
- **Longevity Medical Research**: Addressing aging and disease as relics of the past.

## 5. Economic & Industrial Evolution
- **Resource Management**: Tactical steps to manage the $700 quintillion resource potential of asteroids (e.g., Psyche).
- **Type III Foundations**: Multi-generational development of O'Neill cylinders and galactic logistics spines.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contract platforms for project contribution, regulation, and compensation.

## 6. Digital & AI Safety
- **Alignment**: Ethical upliftment of both human and substrate-independent life.
- **Hygienic Exploration**: Non-invasive study of celestial bodies (Europa, Titan, Venus).
