# Ledger: Planetary Life Support

## SMART Goal: Elimination of Biological Scarcity
**Specific**: Scale orbital organ manufacturing to 100 organs/month and establish self-sustaining polyculture greenhouses in O'Neill cylinders.
**Measurable**: zero-waitlist status for heart/lung transplants in participating regions; 100% nutritional self-sufficiency for initial O'Neill colony prototypes.
**Achievable**: Using zero-gravity bioreactors and V8 Greenhouse AMUs.
**Relevant**: Essential for human health and longevity in a post-scarcity world.
**Time-bound**: Target organ capacity by Q2 2027.

## Actionable Tasks
1. [ ] **Bioreactor Iteration**: Optimize Stage-2 AMU for large-scale cellular scaffolding (Month 2).
2. [ ] **Heritage Seed Bank**: Collect and digitize Earth's heritage polyculture seeds (olive, peach) for orbital catalogs (Month 3).
3. [ ] **Nutrition Sprints**: Solve high-yield carcinogen-free crop cycles in a simulated O'Neill environment (Month 6).
4. [ ] **Clinical Trials**: Partner with AUH for initial human health span research (Month 12).
5. [ ] **Greenhouse Deployment**: Launch the first 10 modular Greenhouse units (Month 18).

## Key Milestones
- **M1**: First heart-scaffold successfully grown in zero-g simulation.
- **M2**: Heritage Seed Vault operational.
- **M3**: First "Abundance Harvest" from Greenhouse AMU.
