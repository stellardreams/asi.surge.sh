## SMART Goal: Elimination of Biological Scarcity, Preservation & Backup of Terrestrial Biodiversity

### Specific

**Organizational & Infrastructure**
- The set of plans here are designed to enable, equip, empower and support the next generation and successive generations of Space Appleseeds.
- ISS will be decommissioned in 2030. Keep decommissioning timelines into consideration when planning orbital unit deployment.
- Determine deployment strategy: test units on ISS before full deployment, or bypass ISS and proceed with alternative platforms?

**Organ Manufacturing & Healthcare**
- Create the first organ manufactured in orbit (ongoing research and multiple questions to resolve).
- Scale organ manufacturing to 100 organs/month as a key milestone.
- Establish successful and long-term organ grafting protocols without infection or health complications.

**Agricultural & Food Systems**
- Establish self-sustaining polyculture greenhouses in O'Neill cylinders (may warrant a separate detailed plan).
- Preserve and digitize Earth's heritage polyculture seed varieties in orbital catalogs.
- Develop high-yield, carcinogen-free crop cycles suitable for simulated O'Neill environments.

### Measurable

**Healthcare Metrics**
- Achieve coordination agreements with healthcare institutions around the world.
- Achieve zero-waitlist status for heart/lung transplants in participating regions.
- Establish robust protocols addressing unintended consequences (market pressures, organ availability inequality, etc.).

**Nutritional Self-Sufficiency**
- Achieve 100% nutritional self-sufficiency for initial O'Neill colony prototypes.
- Document and maintain genetic diversity baseline (10,000+ heritage seed varieties).
- Establish redundant food production systems across multiple orbital and terrestrial facilities.

### Achievable

**Core Technology Platforms**
- Leverage zero-gravity bioreactors for organ manufacturing.
- Utilize V8 Greenhouse AMUs for agricultural production.
- Implement distributed DNA preservation systems (orbital, deep underground, terrestrial backup facilities).

**Biodiversity Preservation Infrastructure**
- Non-Terrestrial Seed Bank system in partnership with Svalbard (see issue #23 for detailed plan).
- Non-Terrestrial DNA Bank with multi-location redundancy (see issue #24 for detailed plan).

### Relevant

**Strategic Importance**
- Essential for human health, longevity, and medical equity in a post-scarcity world.
- Ensures genetic and agricultural diversity survival against terrestrial extinction events.
- Provides biological resilience for multi-planet colonization and long-term human civilization continuity.
- Supports the SMART goal of biological scarcity elimination across all species.

### Time-bound

**Major Milestone Dates**
- **Q2 2027**: Target organ manufacturing capacity milestone.
- **2030**: ISS decommissioning deadline (influences deployment strategy).
- **2035+**: Expanded DNA and seed bank operational across space and underground facilities.
- **10-year projection**: 10,000+ species genetic material preserved with 100-year+ stability guarantees.

## Actionable Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Bioreactor Development
1. [ ] **Bioreactor Iteration**: Optimize Stage-2 AMU for large-scale cellular scaffolding (Month 2). See [issue #12](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh/issues/12)

### Phase 2: Biological Preservation Systems

#### Non-Terrestrial Seed Bank (working with Svalbard)
- [ ] **Heritage Seed Bank Initiative**: Collect and digitize Earth's heritage polyculture seeds for orbital catalogs (Month 3). 
  - See detailed plan: [issue #23](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh/issues/23)
  - Note: The Svalbard team is exceptional; they sent a postcard during COVID simply for asking!
  - Responsibilities: Research partnerships, species prioritization, preservation protocols, metadata cataloging

#### Non-Terrestrial DNA Bank
- [ ] **DNA Preservation System**: Establish distributed DNA backup for genetic diversity preservation across space and underground facilities (Month 4-6).
  - See detailed plan with role assignments: [issue #24](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh/issues/24)
  - Responsibilities: Stakeholder engagement, preservation protocols, facility infrastructure (orbital + underground), database development, security protocols

### Phase 3: Agricultural Development & Testing
3. [ ] **Nutrition Sprints**: Solve high-yield carcinogen-free crop cycles in a simulated O'Neill environment (Month 6).

### Phase 4: Clinical & Deployment Phase
4. [ ] **Clinical Trials**: Partner with AUH (sister organization) for initial human health span research (Month 12). 
   - Contact Knouse lab (follow up on previous inquiry).
5. [ ] **Greenhouse Deployment**: Launch the first 10 modular Greenhouse units (Month 18). 
   - Include both terrestrial and non-terrestrial locations per other integrated plans.

## Key Milestones

**Biological Preservation & Infrastructure**
- **M1**: Heritage Seed Vault operational with 10,000+ species documented and preserved (Svalbard + orbital backup).
- **M2**: DNA Bank Phase 1 complete — all 1,000+ priority species genetically sequenced and stored in 3-location redundancy (1 orbital + 2 underground).
- **M3**: First heart-scaffold successfully grown in zero-g simulation and viability testing completed.

**Medical & Agricultural Production**
- **M4**: First 100 organs manufactured in orbit and successful transplant protocols established (zero infection rate).
- **M5**: First "Abundance Harvest" from Greenhouse AMU with 100% nutritional self-sufficiency metrics achieved.
- **M6**: Clinical trials with AUH complete; human health span metrics demonstrating measurable longevity gains.

**Scale & Sustainability**
- **M7**: 10 modular Greenhouse units deployed across terrestrial and non-terrestrial locations.
- **M8**: DNA Bank expanded to 10,000+ species (10-year expansion target) with 99.99%+ preservation integrity confirmed annually.
- **M9**: Full O'Neill cylinder biological systems operational with self-sustaining polyculture and zero external resource dependency.
