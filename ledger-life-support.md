# Ledger: Planetary Life Support

## SMART Goal: elimination of biological scarcity, preservation and backup of terrestrial biodiversity
Specific:
- the set of plans here are really to enable/equip/empower and support the next generation and successive generation Space Appleseeds
- ISS will be decommissioned in 2030
- Get first unit up on ISS, keeping decommissioning of ISS timelines
- Creation of the first organ manufactured in orbit. (but which organ? and does it matter?)
- Before organ manufacturing is scaled 100 organs/month as a further milestone. A lot of questions remain. Most important of which is successful and longterm grafting of organs without any infections or longterm health issues.
- Establish self-sustaining polyculture greenhouses in O'Neill cylinders. (I feel this should be split up. So that it can be built up inside of the plan or a separate plan)

Measurable:
- Co-ordination with healthcare institutions around the world
- Zero-waitlist status for heart/lung transplants in participating regions.
- Anticipating unintended consequences. As a rush would ensue and money will start piling up for individuals who wish to buy organs. 
- 100% nutritional self-sufficiency for initial O'Neill colony prototypes. (same comment as above)

Achievable:
- Using zero-gravity bioreactors and V8 Greenhouse AMUs.

Relevant:
- Essential for human health and longevity in a post-scarcity world.

Time-bound:
- Target organ capacity by Q2 2027.

## Actionable Tasks
1. [ ] **Bioreactor Iteration**: Optimize Stage-2 AMU for large-scale cellular scaffolding (Month 2).
2. [ ] **Non-Terrestrial Seed Bank (working with Svalbard)**: See issue 23 for an initial proposed plan link is [here](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh/issues/23) Collect and digitize Earth's heritage polyculture seeds for orbital catalogs (Month 3). As a note on the side, the Svalbard people are really really nice! Svalbard Tourism sent me a postcard during covid and all I had to do was ask them!
3. [ ] **Nutrition Sprints**: Solve high-yield carcinogen-free crop cycles in a simulated O'Neill environment (Month 6).
4. [ ] **Clinical Trials**: Partner with AUH (sister organization) for initial human health span research (Month 12). | Reach out to Knouse lab again (Did not hear back the first time)
5. [ ] **Greenhouse Deployment**: Launch the first 10 modular Greenhouse units (Month 18). (terrestrial and see location in other plans for non-terrestrial)
6. [ ] **Non-Terrestrial DNA Bank**: See, initial plan version 2.1 here [link](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh/issues/24)

## Key Milestones
- **M1**: First heart-scaffold successfully grown in zero-g simulation.
- **M2**: Heritage Seed Vault operational.
- **M3**: First "Abundance Harvest" from Greenhouse AMU.
