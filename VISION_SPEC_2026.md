# Technical Specification: Solar System Vision 2026

**Purpose**: To evolve the 2018 hand-drawn conceptual sketch into a high-fidelity, scientifically accurate 2026 Master Plan visualization for the Awakened Imagination ecosystem.

## 1. Physical Environment Data

| Body | Mean Distance (AU) | Scale Ratio (Earth=1) | Infrastructure Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sun** | 0.00 | 109.0 | Primary Energy Source / Baseline |
| **Mercury** | 0.39 | 0.38 | Research / Extreme Solar Energy Nodes |
| **Venus** | 0.72 | 0.95 | High-Atmosphere Aerostat Exploration |
| **Earth** | 1.00 | 1.00 | Biosphere Stewardship / Origin Point |
| **Moon** | 1.002 | 0.27 | AUH Research / Heritage Greenhouses |
| **Mars** | 1.52 | 0.53 | Logistical Pivot / Logistics Spine Hub |
| **Asteroid Belt** | 2.20 - 3.20 | Swarms | Stage-3 AMU Extraction (Psyche/Ceres) |
| **Jupiter** | 5.20 | 11.2 | Deep Space Frontier / Water Ice Sources |

## 2. Infrastructure Layer (The ASI Pillars)
*   **Galactic Spines**: Translucent, pulsing cyan curves following the **Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN)** rather than linear paths.
*   **O'Neill Cylinders**: Located at Lagrange points (L4/L5) between Earth/Moon and Earth/Mars. Rendered as rotating toroidal or cylindrical structures.
*   **AMU Swarms**: Clustered around the Asteroid Belt and in transit orbits, visualized as glowing dot-clusters or geometric drones.
*   **Heritage Greenhouses**: Bioluminescent domes visible on the Lunar surface and within O'Neill cylinders.

## 3. Visual Aesthetic Guide
*   **Theme**: "Space Navy" High-Fidelity.
*   **Background**: Deep Navy (`#020c1b`) with a faint, realistic Milky Way band.
*   **Accents**: "Abundance Cyan" (`#64ffda`) for all UI overlays, vectors, and infrastructure glows.
*   **Annotation Style**: Holographic, san-serif (Inter) labels. Distances marked in **AU** for scientific professionalism.
*   **Lighting**: Single-point solar illumination. High contrast between light and shadow to emphasize the vacuum of space.

## 4. Evolution from 2018 Sketch
*   **Accuracy**: The original "353.7 million miles" and "120.6 million miles" labels should be recalculated into precise AU relative to the current orbital epoch.
*   **Jupiter Nodes**: Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa should be explicitly marked as specific resource hubs, moving them from a corner note to a primary distal terminus.
*   **The Sentry Layer**: A faint hexagonal grid or computer-vision overlay periodically appearing across LEO and MEO to represent the **Orbital Sentry** compute layer.
