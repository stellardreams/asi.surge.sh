# Awake Space Industries

> **Mission**: Explore space to improve human reality and promote a sustainable, peaceful, and strategic presence in outer space for the benefit of all.

Welcome to the **Awakened Imagination Group of Projects**. This repository hosts the landing page and foundational documentation for Awake Space Industries (ASI).

## 🌌 Vision

ASI is dedicated to unlocking the potential of the inner solar system to address Earth's challenges. We focus on:
- **Orbital Manufacturing**: Enabling semi-autonomous factories in space.
- **Biotech in Orbit**: Growing organs (hearts, lungs) in zero-gravity environments.
- **Space Colonies**: Supporting the creation of sustainable O'Neill colonies for future generations.
- **AI & Space Safety**: Promoting norms and behaviors for peaceful space development and mitigating the harmful effects of superabundance.

## 🚀 Key Projects

- **AMU (Autonomous Manufacturing Units)**: 3-stage semi-autonomous factories designed for orbiting greenhouses and decentralized manufacturing. [snapshot](https://asi.surge.sh/effort) each AMU can make a copy of itself to scale production. each AMU can reorient itself to make a manufacturing unit of choosing. TRL [Technology Readiness Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) level is between TRL 1 and TRL 2
- **Governance**: the structure for goverance for ASI has not been setup as of yet. considering that the organization could generate a substantial amount of profits and revenue, amounting in the Trillions. hence, it is best that the organization is setup in a manner that it's revenues go towards enabling a global infrastructure for healthcare (See AUH below). for this purpose, the nations around the world and United Nations would audit all the operations of this organization all the time, everytime. every process initiated by the kernel and every transaction on the accounting ledger would be visible to the appropriate governig authorities.
- **AUH (Awake Universal Healthcare)**: Developing quality healthcare infrastructure for the solar system. please see [https://auh.surge.sh/](https://auh.surge.sh/) for more details
- **Shangrila-VHP**: Veterans Healing Places using earthen materials and sustainable resources. please see [https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/)for more information. As well, the [issues](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues) section and the [wiki](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/wiki) also

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS, JavaScript (jQuery/Bootstrap).
- **Tracking**: Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity.
