# Awake Space Industries

> **Mission**: Explore space to improve human reality and promote a sustainable, peaceful, and strategic presence in outer space for the benefit of all.

Welcome to the **Awakened Imagination Group of Projects**. This repository hosts the landing page and foundational documentation for Awake Space Industries (ASI).

## 🌌 Vision

ASI is dedicated to unlocking the potential of the inner solar system to address Earth's challenges. We focus on:
- **Orbital Manufacturing**: Enabling semi-autonomous factories in space.
- **Biotech in Orbit**: Growing organs (hearts, lungs) in zero-gravity environments.
- **Space Colonies**: Supporting the creation of sustainable O'Neill colonies for future generations.
- **AI & Space Safety**: Promoting norms and behaviors for peaceful space development and mitigating the harmful effects of superabundance.

## 🚀 Key Projects

- **AMU (Autonomous Manufacturing Units)**: 3-stage semi-autonomous factories designed for orbiting greenhouses and decentralized manufacturing. [snapshot](https://asi.surge.sh/effort) each AMU can make a copy of itself to scale production. each AMU can reorient itself to make a manufacturing unit of choosing. TRL [Technology Readiness Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) level is between TRL 1 and TRL 2
- **Governance**: 
  - the structure for goverance for ASI has not been setup as of yet. considering that the organization could generate a substantial amount of profits and revenue, amounting in the Trillions. hence, it is best that the organization is setup in a manner that it's revenues go towards enabling a global infrastructure for healthcare (See AUH below). 
  - for this purpose, the nations around the world and United Nations would audit all the operations of this organization all the time, everytime. every process initiated by the kernel and every transaction on the accounting ledger would be visible to the appropriate governing authorities.
  - basically we sought to enable Gerry K' O'Neill's vision. you can learn more about Gerry by reading a book titled [visioneers](https://www.amazon.ca/Visioneers-Scientists-Colonies-Nanotechnologies-Limitless/dp/0691176299) by W. Patrick McCray. later on, there was a documentary made about gerry. which you can stream on the internet. here's the imdb [link](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12483148/). Digital artist, Erik Wernquist worked on some of the scenes for the documentary. you can see the trailer on his personal youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSsWkooeIds)
  - from my vantage point, when gerry's vision is going to begin to manifest is a question of when and not if. I personally did not know gerry. but if ASI starts taking off, it would only be kind to do something in gerry's memory by working closely and respectfully with his family. as of yet, I don't know anyone in gerry's family or circle of friends.
- **AUH (Awake Universal Healthcare)**: Developing quality healthcare infrastructure for the solar system. please see [https://auh.surge.sh/](https://auh.surge.sh/) for more details
- **Shangrila-VHP**: Veterans Healing Places using earthen materials and sustainable resources. please see [https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/)for more information. As well, the [issues](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues) section and the [wiki](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/wiki) also

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Architecture**: 
  - Designed for radical transparency and eventual blockchain-based regulation of swarms. 
  - smaller units designed to enable and equip pre-approved modular realms in a post AGI world (Artificial General Intelligence).
  - it the the hope that the depth and fidelity of simulations will improve with the increased availability of computational power.
  - separately, I will be advocating for the rights for intelligences that are independent of a substrate. only then can the simulations begin to evolve in an organic manner

## 🌐 Deployment

The site is currently hosted at [asi.surge.sh](https://asi.surge.sh/).

## 🤝 Contributing

for this vision to evolve, you can now make this project your own. starting with:
- Lead Ethicists
- Habitat Designers
- Gardeners of the Galaxy
- Materials Scientists
- And more...
