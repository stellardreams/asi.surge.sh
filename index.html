<h2> Mission</h2>
To unite intelligent life in order to help enable a better reality for all. Feed the world quality and nutritious foods by going to space. Create beautiful physical surroundings on and off of earth.

<h2>Primary areas of interest</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Terraform Venus.</li>
  <p>
  The primary idea is to put an autonomous factory in the orbit of Venus. This factory is going to create units, that will be launched in the atmosphere of Venus. The units are specifically designed for the purpose of sequestering larger amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere of Venus. Realizing the fact that this is a very harsh environment.</p>
   <img src="img/CanadaArm2.png" alt="Canadaarm2 image, courtesy of picryl.com. S117E08851." style="width:42%">

  <li>Enable or help enable O'Neill colonies and Stanford Toruses. For the purpose of longer term settlements, scientific and mining outposts, deep space exploration (Exploring the solar system and beyond!)</li>
  <li>Exploring Europa in a hygienic manner.</li>
  <li>Extract hydrocarbons from Titan. Provided no life has been found on the planet.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Sister companies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://auh.surge.sh/" target="_blank"> Awake Universal Healthcare. </a></li> | <b>Note:</b> All of our profits will be redirected to AUH. For the purpose of enabling a quality healthcare infrastructure for the solar system. Minus a salary for the employees (base and compensation. Capped at a certain rate and inflation adjusted), R&D (Research and development) efforts, supporting a limited number of charities and enabling the architecture for impact pledges.
  <li><a href="https://www.launchtoday.org/" target="_blank"> Launch Today. </a></li>

<h2> Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Radical transparency.</li>
  <li>Trust.</li>
  <li>Help reduce and to eventually eliminate all unnecessary suffering.</li>
  <li>Promoting freedoms.</li>
  <li>Leave a place better than we experienced it.</li>
