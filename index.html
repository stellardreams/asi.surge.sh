        Developing outer space is the pivotal requirement for humanity to secure the <strong>Age of Abundance</strong>.
        At the Awake Group, we coordinate this evolution through the <strong>Wikipedia Model</strong>—establishing a
        radically transparent, collaborative structure for orbital development and AI safety. As a <strong>Public
          Benefit
          Organization</strong>, our focus is the collective healing of the biosphere and the advancement of sentient
        life across the solar system.

      <hr>
      <p>
        In 2018, inspired by W. Patrick McCray's book <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Visioneers-Scientists-Colonies-Nanotechnologies-Limitless/dp/0691139830"
          target="_blank">The Visioneers</a>, I began exploring the <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lc2GkuP1nc" target="_blank">'responsibility of our creations'</a> and
        the profound impact of our interactions with
        technology.
        Having worked in the technology sector, I have always been fascinated by how these interactions shape our
        reality.
        As a dreamer, I meditated on the possibility that unlocking the inner solar system's potential could address
        many
        of Earth's greatest challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a parent, I dream of a future where generations rise above earthly struggles and reach for the stars to build
        a
        better world. This vision hinges on a collaborative, safe, sustainable, and ethical approach. Driven by this
        mission, I sketched an initial diagram in 2018, which you can view below in its original form.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a mindset of greatness, we can achieve more than we ever imagined. As Les Brown says, "Shoot for the stars.
        Even if you miss, you'll land on the moon." Or, as the late Neil Armstrong envisioned, we must strive to "go to
        places beyond belief."

        Our design for the Government of Canada's <strong>Deep Space Food Challenge</strong> envisions millions of
        non-terrestrial facilities providing high-yield, carcinogen-free nutrition. While it pushed the boundaries of
        the
        competition's constraints, it remains our foundational blueprint for solving global food scarcity and anchoring
        future O'Neill colonies.

        Beyond the mandates and the legal frameworks, we extend an open hand of friendship to all who reach for the

        In the coming <strong>Age of Abundance</strong>, our solar system offers more than enough resources to uplift
        every sentient life. As highlighted in the <a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/economics-of-the-stars/"
