<p>
In 2018, inspired by Patrick McCray's book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visioneers-Scientists-Colonies-Nanotechnologies-Limitless/dp/0691139830/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.a94V7WcBMemuiPPMeemevw.f1puM_k0PFb8Tl1tgc5YAsMkH14w5JzsXXSepV6dz8s&dib_tag=se&keywords=visioneers+patrick&qid=1730525586&sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Visioneers</a>, I started thinking about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lc2GkuP1nc" target="_blank">'responsibility of our creations'</a> and our interactions with our very own creations. Being fortunate to work in the tech industry prior to, I always enjoyed thinking about how we as human interact with technology and the impact that this interaction has on us. As a dreamer, I then starting meditating on the possibility that unlocking the inner solar system's potential could address many of Earth's challenges.

As a parent, I have a dream for the well-being of future generations, where humanity rises above earthly struggles and reaches for the stars to create a better world. This vision hinges on a collaborative, safe, secure, sustainable, and ethical approach. Driven by this thought, I sketched an initial diagram, a copy of which you can witness in it's original form below.

As Les Brown would say, "Shoot for the stars. Even if you miss, you'll land on the moon." With this mindset, we can achieve greatness beyond our wildest dreams. Or as the late Lieutenant Neil Armstrong would say, 'go to places beyond belief.'

Going to space is a big part of ensuring that we can all benefit from the coming age of abundance. 
<p>
At the Awake group, I committed towards making the world that we want to live in. I (Adeel Khan) hope that you will join us on this journey. I want to borrow from the same mechanisms that led towards the enablement of Wikipedia and help put a structure in place for developing outer space and AI safety. The proceeds are something that should be deployed for the collective benefit of all of humans, the healing of the biosphere and towards ensuring that the Future of Life is increasingly better. For these reasons and more, I would like to setup mechanisms by which the Awake group operates in as transparent a manner as possibly. With the proceeds going to endeavours via an organization that is going to be setup as a 'public benefit organization.'
</p> 
<p>
Here are the areas of impact and and the developing areas of interest that we have identified:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Our existing mission is to help feed the world quality and nutritious foods by going to space. We also want to grow hearts, lungs and other organs in orbit. Because the zero gravity environment is great for growing organs. As well, move all heavy and polluting industries away from Earth. Thus setting the foundation of a manufacturing base in space.</li> 
<li>We are keen on running all of our operations in a radically transparent manner. Whereby the ventures sustain themselves and we can harness energy, ideas, suggestions from all the different parts of the reality. And rewards are transferred based on the contribution of the individual.</li>
<li>Going back to our vision, we want to enable beautiful & healthy surroundings on and off of earth. For ourselves and the future generations. Starting with a small scale agricultural and medical facility in space makes good sense. Because lots of teams from different backgrounds can collaborate to make this vision a reality. It is our intention that these facilities can be scaled in an exponential manner, in a manner that is safe/secure/equitable/sustainable and satisfactory for all parties and individuals involved. Time is of the essence.</li>
<li>To operate in any domain, you need to secure it. So we want to help secure the domain of space, in a civilian capacity.</li>
<li>Help with the introduction of norms and behaviour. So that we can continue to promote the peaceful and sustainable development of outer space.</li>
<li>Assist with setting the foundations of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Type_III_civilization_methods target=" target="_blank">Type III civilization.</a> In a manner that does not infringe upon the life or quality of life of another being. Find other life across the Galaxy and the universe at large.</li>
</ul>



<p><mark>Radical transparency:</mark> The super high-level details (headings mostly) of most of the work (I'd say 40%) is viewable by all. Link is here and the listing is embedded below for limited yet dynamic viewing. <a href="https://sharing.clickup.com/l/h/4-3461412-1/88677a3e84aec47" target="_blank "><mark>here</mark></a>.

Below: A semi-autonomous manufacturing site that can make copies of itself. As well, help manufacture inventions by approved vendors and customers. This is a proposed design for an invention and as of right now, Awake Aerospace has pioneered simple designs to enable this reality. Would love to collaborate with other robotic companies in the future.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Below is a screenshot of Awake Aerospace's submission to the Governmet of Canada's 'Deep Space Food Challenge'. The dimensions that we originally conceived, were scaled down a lot, in order to meet the constraints outlined in the challenge. Unfortunately the submission made was not chosen as one of the teams that will proceed to the next level. The vision is to have hundreds of thousands or millions of such facilities in non-terrestrial orbits (Meaning, not Earth's orbit). This is a design that Awake Aerospace will continue iterating on. This design has the potential for helping solve all of the major problems on Earth. As well, setting the foundations for humans to migrate to secure and safe O'Neill colonies in the future. The proposition is to start with growing food in outer space. Quality, nutritious foods for all life. Foods that are free of carcinogens and harmful chemicals. 
</p>
<br>
<img src="img/portfolio/Awake_RG_AMU_Orbiting_Greenhouses.png" alt="Awake Aerospace Orbiting Greenhouse." style="width:42%">
<br>
<p>
The '3 stage' AMU (semi-autonomous manufacturing unit). Includes, the main manufacturing site (MMS) (can replicate itself and re-organize itself in order to make different inventions), fuel tanks and a transporter for moving goods and services. Produce will be washed, dried and then flash-frozen without the use of chemicals. Multiple transporters will dock into a singular body (MMS). The re-entry problem is being solved by a lot of other companies. The overall cycle looks something like this:<br> 
<ul>
<li>Food is grown in semi-autonomous AMUS. Some activities are performed remotely.</li>
<li>Transporters take the produce and do a hand-off with a mechanism in Earth's orbit.</li>
<li>Re-entry and landing at a commercial space port.</li>
<li>Last mile delivery: Autonomous trucks coupled with robotics. Customers received a box of freeze dried produce.</li>
</ul>

Overall:<br>
<ul>
<li>Making heavy use of robotics and automation is pivotal towards feeding all humans, pets and potentially other animals.</li> 
<li>We also envision that there is going to be a computing platform operating somewhere in space. With increasing levels of computation available, computationally heavy tasks like computer vision and writing blocks to the blockchain can be had. This way, if a mechanism that is not authorized is triggered within the range of or within our facilities. In such a situation, security and law-enforcement specific procedures and actions will be automatically initiated.</li>
<li>Enabling this project in a collaborative, inclusive manner is a good confidence building measure. Tackling food security is an urgent need and it is also something that could be felt more acutely, given the changing nature of our climate. We have been sharing a lot of our work openly. But we sense that our work is getting copied and other parties are throwing money behind the work that we did and calling it their own. Right now, we do not have the funds to contest this in a court of law. It is our hope that as we raise funds, that there is the development of a basic legal framework, via which we can ensure that the vision actually materializes the way we intended. Meaning, that these facilities are leveraged for the purpose of growing quality nutritious foods, growing organs and other cellular structures of good use. As well for enabling manufacturing facilities for the greater benefit of humans and all life.</li>
</ul>

<br>



<h2>Primary areas of interest</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Foundation for a Type III civilization</li>
   <p>
  Immediate area of focus is to see secure, safe, sustainable and environmentally conscious operations in space. We will work with any and all parties who adhere to and respect a common set of norms. Parties who are working towards enabling provisions in order to detect and deter undesirable behaviours. As well, help enable a legal structure in order to hold bad actors and polluters accountable. 
  </p>
  <li>Semi-autonomous factories in space</li>
  <p>
  When the time is right, when the economics makes good sense and when the domain is secured. This is the time when we would like to deploy our existing '3 stage' designs for the semi-autonomous factories in space. We worked on these designs from January 2021 till the mid of July. Both Rusith Gimhana and myself dedicated focused effort towards turning our back of the envelope ideas into functional designs and simulations. (Note: The team split up in August, 2021) The primary mission involves enabling manufacturing facilities outside of Earth. As well, facilities for agriculture in space. Our '3 stage' semi-autonomous factories, will primarily be creating O'Neill colonies and Stanford Toruses. The intent is that all players and parties can collaborate, compete or mix of (coopetition) in order to help make life better for all. I (Adeel Khan) am against the placement of heavy weapons in space. I have love in my heart for all humans and all other life on this planet. World peace is possible. We must continue changing ourselves and we must continue making investments that will bring more hope and healing. We are all connected to each other. Perhaps in ways that we have yet to truly recognize and appreciate. Personally, it has been my mission to change myself and I (Adeel Khan) have had some successes. The work must continue indefinitely. May my heart be pure and may I continue doing good that is universal, in the world.  
</p>

  <li>Enable or help enable: Scientific and mining outposts, longer term settlements in particular orbits and also for deep space exploration (Exploring the solar system and beyond!)</li>
  <li>Exploring Europa in a hygienic manner. Provided no life has been found.</li>
  <li>Extract hydrocarbons from Titan. " "</li>
  <li>Initially we were focused on developing a framework for terraforming Venus. However, in October 2021 it has come to our attention that there is indeed a high probability that there could be life on Venus. (Source: A talk by Dr. Sara Seager via the Mars Society Conference). So we scrapped that idea. We'd like to assist with the development of techniques being developed for sequestering CO2 on Earth. Which was our intent from the get go. Meaning, reverse engineering the technologies that we were developing in order to deploy them inside of and in the orbit of Venus and bring these technologies back to Earth. For them to be placed in human-made caves. We've given this some thought (energy requirements, water intake using sustainable means, new-age techniques via genetics +) and have done some initial calculations.</li>


 </p>
  
  <p>
   Our longer term vision is to see a distributed set of teams in the form of 'swarms' operating on top of the blockchain technology. Ideally, individuals and teams will come together in order to help manifest good dreams. The system will have the means and the ability in order to identify meaningful contributions. Basically we'd like swarms to regulate themselves and then do the heavy lifting. The individuals within those swarms will be compensated really well for their meaningful contributions. However, this (overall) concept, this thought of enabling swarms is something that we haven't had a chance to give focused attention to. Clearly, there are many problems that need to be solved in order for this vision to come true. There are also many legal, ethical, moral and societal considerations that have to be thought through. Before steps are taken in order to enable this sub-idea of enabling swarms. The current state of our global healthcare systems, with a keen and particular focus on the lack of affordable and quality mental health related services. This reality posits that there is a lot of opportunity here. Next, it is the issue of timing in the form of human well-being. Because if this mechanism is enabled today, then the swarms are only going to be as good as the quality of the thought processes within these swarms. Overall, I (Adeel Khan) have this thought that swarms could play a crucial role towards expediting certain cycles of innovations. As well, could help play a crucial role towards mitigating certain existential risks. However, the enablement of swarms must never be considered as the only insurance policy towards mitigating risks existential of a nature.

<h2> For Future partners (employees) at Awake</h2>
We offer:
<ul>
	<li>A collaborative, open, inclusive work environment. Where ideas > heirarchy</li>
	<li>Base salary</li>
  	<li>Shares in the organization are going to be allocated based on a) A vesting schedule and b) The human population will actually determine what the individual contributor's share should be. This is something that we are currently evaluating. As well, this is something that we are going to build on top of a public/private blockchain. Effectively speaking, the organization and the original founding team is not going to have control over how the shares are allocated.</li>
	<li>Benefits. Including but not limited to: Health insurance, basic dental related service (for now), mental health, vision care (eyeglasses and eye exams for now), sick days (physiological, psychological, emotional well-being). <b>Note:</b> Everything is super basic right now. As we do not have sales and we have not raised any money. </li>
	<li>Schedule: I (Adeel Khan) work almost all the time. I get 8 to 9 hours of sleep and dedicate quality time for exercise and socializing. This is a startup and so you are expected to work almost all the time. Suffice to say, you must enjoy the work that you are doing and you should be working almost all the time. Within reason. If you like to work, are eager to learn, have a growth mindset, possess a good work ethic --> then you can be trained in most areas. I personally invest a lot of time with new hires. We have an evolving process in place. Happy to share the details.
  </li>
	<li>Open to suggestions. What else should be added to this list?</li>
</ul>


<h2> Our work to date</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/85qk9-329/588e103c74123c4" target="_blank">Universal milestones and mission statement</a></li>

<p></p>

<h2> Problems/Opportunities space</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Technical</li>
		<ul>
			<li>No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel" target="_blank">known technology</a> exists at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level" target="_blank">TRL Level 9</a>. That can safely take (and bring back) humans or machines to the destination of choice.
			<li>Many problems will need to be solved, before an autonomous or semi-autonomous manufacturing facility can be launched in the orbit of a planetary body. Some of these very issues, and in various domains have been highlighted below. However, this is definitely not a comprehensive list. It is critical to highlight that placing larger structures in Earth's orbit can cause a whole host of security and safety related issues. Now and in the future. As well, if compromised this can create some serious vulnerabilities for global safety. This is the reason why the development of deep space is being advocated. This way, goods and material can be moved throughout the solar system by leveraging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_Transport_Network" target="_blank">ITN (Interplanetary Transport Network)</a>. Also considering the financial and other costs involved, reusable rocket-propulsion technology will not suffice in order to move larger amounts of mass to and from orbit. In a manner whereby security and safety hazards and pollution is not left after some years of activity. This is why the proposition of non-rocket based propulsion technologies being developed is necessary. 
       </li>
		</ul>
	<li>Financial</li>
		<ul>
			<li>As of this point in time. The following costs are not known:
				<ul>
					<li>Actual cost towards successfully completing specific milestones is not yet known. Hence, the overall cost is also something that is not known as of this point in time.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The platform enabled on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank">'smart contract'</a> technology is yet to be developed. We anticipate a world where anyone/anywhere can contribute towards the enablement of this project. And be adequately compensated for doing so. Provided the work is of sufficient quality. 		 	
		</ul>
  <li>Economic</li>
    <li>Will a for-profit mechanism still be operational. Why or why not.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It is said that asteroid <b>Psyche</b> alone contains, quote: 'US$700 quintillion worth of gold, enough for every person on earth to receive about US$93 billion.' Source: <a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/economics-of-the-stars/" target="_blank">link</a>
      </li>
    </ul>


	<li>Ethical</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Security: Provisions against ensuring that the technology is not abused and weaponized.</li>
    <li>Life on other planets: As highlighted above, there is evidence to suggest that there could be life on other planets within the solar system. We should focus on enabling structures that are manufactured by humans. Terraforming existing planets does not set a good precedent in the short, mid or longer term. Particularly for the the time range when we aim to explore the next star systems. However far away in the future that may be.</li>
    <li>What will humans do in a world of Superabundance? What provisions must exist so that problems of ennui do not become chronic problems. What measures must be under-taken in order to think about and mitigate from the harmful effects of Superabundance & the need to start today. Two videos that I (Adeel Khan) have posted on my channel on Youtube on November the 1st, 2024 are on topic here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AdeelKhan1/videos" target="_blank"> </li>link</a>
		</ul>		

	<li>Legal</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The lack of a global framework for governance may pose challenges. On the other hand, a very strict regulatory framework may prevent new ideas from being tested and/or may perpetuate a monopolistic framework. A monopolistic framework that isn't good for the common good of all life.</li>
			<li>A structure for ensuring that further amendments and as it relates to the <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html" target="_blank">Outer Space Treaty</a> are the set of changes that are going to be good (in a universal sense of the word imaginable) for the majority of life on this planet.</li>
			<li>What sort of a legal framework/structure must organizations and individuals adhere to.</li>

  <li>Sustainability</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The issue of debris in space or space-debris has already gotten quite acute. The primary reason for this are a lack of a legal structure whereby players can be held accountable. This issue is compounded when nation-states and now private players treat Earth's orbit as an infinite resource, which it is not. The launches since the 60's have clutter the different orbits. In the past couple of years, ASAT testing (anti-satellite attacks against one's own satellites) have resulted into a lot of debris. This debris can be very small, down to the mm (millimetre scale). The debris of varying sizes, travelling at high velocities has already started causing problems for infrastructure in outer space.</li>
