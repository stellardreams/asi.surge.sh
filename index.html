<h2> Mission</h2>
Enable agricultural and industrial outposts in space. Help set the foundations for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Type_III_civilization_methods target=" target="_blank">Type III civilization.</a>

Our existing mission is to help feed the world quality and nutritious foods by going to space. We must and we will create beautiful & healthy surroundings on and off of earth. For ourselves and the future generations.

<p>
Below: A semi-autonomous manufacturing site that can make copies of itself. As well, enable inventions of our choosing. This is our invention and we have simple set of simulations here. In the future, we'd love to work with Mitsubishi electric and other robotic companies.

<p>
Our submission to the Governmet of Canada's 'Deep Space Food Challenge'. We scaled down our designs in order to meet the constraints outlined in the challenge. Unfortunately we were not chosen as one of the teams that will proceed to the next level. Our dream is to have hundreds of thousands or millions of such facilities in non-terrestrial orbits (Meaning, not Earth's orbit). This is one design that we will continue iterating on. Because this is the design that will help solve hunger and malnutrition. Quality, nutritious foods that are free of carcinogenics and harmful chemicals.

<p>
The '3 stage' AMU (semi-autonomous manufacturing unit). Includes, the main manufacturing site (MMS) (can replicate itself and re-organize itself in order to make different inventions), fuel tanks and a transporter for moving goods and services. Produce will be washed, dried and then flash-frozen without the use of chemicals. Multiple transporters will dock into a singular body (MMS). The re-entry problem is being solved by a lot of other companies. The overall cycle looks something like this: Food is grown in semi-autonomous AMUS --> Transporters take the produce and do a hand-off with a mechanism in Earth's orbit --> Re-entry and landing at a commercial space port --> Autonomous trucks coupled with robotics. Overall, making heavy use of robotics and automation is pivotal towards feeding all humans, pets and potentially other animals.

<h2>Primary areas of interest</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Foundation for a Type III civilization</li>
   <p>
  Immediate area of focus is to see secure, safe, sustainable and environmentally conscious operations in space. We will work with any and all parties who adhere to and respect a common set of norms. Parties who are working towards enabling provisions in order to detect and deter undesirable behaviours. As well, help enable a legal structure in order to hold bad actors and polluters accountable. 
  </p>
  <li>Semi-autonomous factories in space</li>
  <p>
  When the time is right, when the economics makes good sense and when the domain is secured. This is the time when we would like to deploy our existing '3 stage' designs for the semi-autonomous factories in space. We worked on these designs from January 2021 till the mid of July. Both Rusith and myself dedicated focused effort towards turning our back of the envelope ideas into functional designs and simulations. The primary mission involves enabling manufacturing facilities outside of Earth. As well, facilities for agriculture in space. Our '3 stage' semi-autonomous factories, will primarily be creating O'Neill colonies and Stanford Toruses. The intent is that all players and parties can collaborate, compete or mix of (coopetition) in order to help make life better for all. We are against the placement of heavy weapons in space and we will use all peaceful and reasonable resources at our disposal in order to prevent an out of control arms race in space. An out of control arms race could end the human civilization. An out of control arms race also takes precious cognition away from areas including healthcare, wellness in general. Which translates into more misery, more suffering, more sick people. The pandemic has brought to surface the fragility of our systems, the need for enabling resiliency. Most importantly, the pandemic has made us realize that all life on this planet is connected. Perhaps in ways that we have yet to truly recognize and appreciate.</p>

  <li>Enable or help enable: Scientific and mining outposts, longer term settlements in particular orbits and also for deep space exploration (Exploring the solar system and beyond!)</li>
  <li>Exploring Europa in a hygienic manner. Provided no life has been found.</li>
  <li>Extract hydrocarbons from Titan. " "</li>
  <li>Initially we were focused on developing a framework for terraforming Venus. However, in October 2021 it has come to our attention that there is indeed a high probability that there could be life on Venus. (Source: A talk by Dr. Sara Seager via the Mars Society Conference). So we scrapped that idea. We'd like to assist with the development of techniques being developed for sequestering CO2 on Earth. Which was our intent from the get go. Meaning, reverse engineering the technologies that we were developing in order to deploy them inside of and in the orbit of Venus and bring these technologies back to Earth. For them to be placed in human-made caves. We've given this some thought (energy requirements, water intake using sustainable means, new-age techniques via genetics +) and have done some initial calculations.</li>


 </p>
  <li>Radical transparency: A distributed autonomous organization that is built on top of blockchain</li>
  <p>
   Ideally, individuals and teams will come together in order to help manifest good dreams. The system will have the means and the ability in order to identify meaningful contributions. Basically we'd like swarms to regulate themselves and then do the heavy lifting. The individuals within those swarms will be compensated really well for their meaningful contributions. However, this (overall) is not an area we know about much at this point in time. So if someone is aware of developments in the blockchain space that could help solve this problem, then please let us know!

<h2> For Future partners (employees) at Awake</h2>
We offer:
<ul>
	<li>A collaborative, open, inclusive work environment. Where ideas > heirarchy</li>
	<li>Base salary</li>
  	<li>Shares in the organization are going to be allocated based on a) A vesting schedule and b) The human population will actually determine what the individual contributor's share should be. This is something that we are currently evaluating. As well, this is something that we are going to build on top of a public/private blockchain. Effectively speaking, the organization and the original founding team is not going to have control over how the shares are allocated.</li>
	<li>Benefits. Including but not limited to: Health insurance, basic dental related service (for now), mental health, vision care (eyeglasses and eye exams for now), sick days (physiological, psychological, emotional well-being). <b>Note:</b> Everything is super basic right now. As we do not have sales and we have not raised any money. </li>
	<li>Schedule: I (Adeel Khan) work almost all the time. I get 8 to 9 hours of sleep and dedicate quality time for exercise and socializing. This is a startup and so you are expected to work almost all the time. Suffice to say, you must enjoy the work that you are doing and you should be working almost all the time. Within reason. If you like to work, are eager to learn, have a growth mindset, possess a good work ethic --> then you can be trained in most areas. I personally invest a lot of time with new hires. We have an evolving process in place. Happy to share the details.
  </li>
	<li>Open to suggestions. What else should be added to this list?</li>

That can safely take (and bring back) humans or machines to the destination of choice.
			<li>No one has launched an autonomous manufacturing unit in an actual orbit of a planetary body. We anticipate many problems that will need to be solved here.</li>
      <strike>
			<li>A core part towards ensuring mission success is the need to see breakthroughs in the domain of materials science. As of right now, this is not something that we have timed. Meaning, we do not know what is the current state of development and as it relates to this discipline of science/engineering.</li>
      </strike>
      <strike>
			<li>We do not know how larger amounts of CO2 are going to be sequestered. Once sequestered/fixed, a solution for transporting the CO2 has yet to be devised.</li>
      </strike>
      <strike>
			<li>As of right now, there are no adequate provisions for the harsh conditions that constructs that enter the atmosphere of Venus are going to experience. Including but not limited to: 
      </strike>
				<ul>
          <strike>
					<li>Corrosion due to the presence of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere</li>
					<li>Extremely strong winds. Depending on the altitude, the winds can be excess of hundreds of km (Upto 360 km/h or 220 mph)</li>
					<li>Extreme temperatures. Hot and cold.</li>
          </strike>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>Financial</li>
		<ul>
			<li>As of this point in time. The following costs are not known:
				<ul>
					<li>Actual cost towards successfully completing specific milestones is not yet known. Hence, the overall cost is also something that is not known as of this point in time.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The platform enabled on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank">'smart contract'</a> technology is yet to be developed. We anticipate a world where anyone/anywhere can contribute towards the enablement of this project. And be adequately compensated for doing so. Provided the work is of sufficient quality. 
				 	
		</ul>
  	<li>Ethical</li>
  		<ul>
			<li>Security: Provisions against ensuring that the technology is not abused and weaponized.</li> 
  		</ul>		

	<li>Legal</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The lack of a global framework for governance may pose challenges. On the other hand, a very strict regulatory framework may prevent new ideas from being tested and/or may perpetuate a monopolistic framework. A monopolistic framework that isn't good for the common good of all life.</li>
			<li>A structure for ensuring that further amendments and as it relates to the <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html" target="_blank">Outer Space Treaty</a> are the set of changes that are going to be good (in a universal sense of the word imaginable) for the majority of life on this planet.</li>
			<li>What sort of a legal framework/structure must organizations and individuals adhere to.</li>  
			<li>How will the land mass be divided.</li>
			<li>Will a for-profit mechanism still be operational. Why or why not.</li>
